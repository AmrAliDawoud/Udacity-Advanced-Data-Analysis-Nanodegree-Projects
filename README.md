# Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree

### Amr Ali Dawoud Created on 06-June-2021

The repository contains projects for Udacity's [Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 

This course focuses on Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, A/B Hypothesis Testing, and Regression analysis.

### Part 1: Investigate a Dataset -Introduction to Data Analysis
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

##### Project - Investigate a Dataset

You will choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

### Part 2: Practical Statistics

Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

##### Project - Analyze A/B Test Results

Analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to decide whether the company should implement new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to increase user conversion rate.

#### Selected topics of Practical Statistics
- 2.1 Descriptive Statistics Part 1 and Part 2
- 2.2 Admission Case Study- Learn to ask the right quesiton, as you learn about Simpson's Paradox.
- 2.3 Probability
- 2.4 Binomial Distribution
- 2.5 Conditional Probability
- 2.6 Bayes Rule
- 2.7 Python Probability Practice
- 2.8 Normal Distribution Theory
- 2.9 Sampling Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem
- 2.10 Confidence Intervals
- 2.11 Hypothesis Testing and A/B Tests
- 2.12 Regression
- 2.13 Multiple Linear Regression
- 2.14 Logistic Regression

### Part 3: Data Visualization

Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

##### Project - Communicate Data Findings

You will use Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, you will create a presentation that communicates your findings to others.

[Communicate Data Findings](https://github.com/AmrAliDawoud/Udacity-Advanced-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/main/3\)%20Communicate%20Data%20Findings/Ford_GoBike_Data_Exploration_Part_1.ipynb)
